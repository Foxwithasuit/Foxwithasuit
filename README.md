- 👋 Hi, I’m @Foxwithasuit
- 👀 I’m interested in Radio astronomy, SDR and such
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn python 
- 💞️ I’m looking for friends or volunteers to collaborate with on my project, its a small Project that utilzes various Radio Sensors and Tech to
  help locate people that may be stuck under rubble after the event of a natural disaster, hardware is completely funded by me, end goal is to hopefully turn this project to a reality and start a company based on this idea
